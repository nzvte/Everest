 <h1>Everest, Next-Gen Roblox Exploitation Toolkit</h1>
</div>

# Description

Everest is a next-gen Roblox exploitation hub in development, and is meant to replace every script hub that's mean't to work universally to-date. Everest covers so many features other's don't have, or were thought to not exist. Compatibility with Everest has been limited to the Synapse X executor, due to the fact that is supports more features than any other script executor to-date, with Everest having over 2 years of development gone into it.

Enjoy!

# Installation

In order to use, or even execute Everest, you will need to buy the Synapse X executor from the official website located here: [Synapse X Official Website](https://x.synapse.to/). All proper documentation for setting up Synapse X is also included on their website. After setting up Synapse X, you will need to go into any of your favorite Roblox games, click attach, copy, paste, and execute the following code:

```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Th3Tr1ckst3r/Everest/main/Loader/EverestLoader.lua"))()
```

You can even save it into your Synapse's Autoexecute folder, and it works great!
